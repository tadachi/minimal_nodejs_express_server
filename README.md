#### Development

Use this command in the same directory with the [package.json](https://github.com/tadachi/minimal_nodejs_express_server/blob/master/package.json) file to install all the dependencies to get the node dev server working.

To get the server running,

```bash
node server.js

Listening on port: 4000
